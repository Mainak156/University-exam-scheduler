🚀 University Exam Timetable Scheduler 🎓📅
📌 Concepts Used: Graph Coloring, Backtracking
📌 Tech Stack: Python/Java (for scheduling), MySQL/PostgreSQL (to store timetable data)

📝 Project Overview
This project is an automated exam timetable scheduler that ensures:
✅ No two exams for the same student clash.
✅ Efficient scheduling considering different courses, batches, departments, and years.
✅ Scalable and optimized exam slot allocation using Graph Coloring & Backtracking algorithms.

🔹 Features
Conflict-Free Scheduling: Ensures that students do not have overlapping exams.
Customizable Constraints: Supports different departments, years, and courses.
Optimized Slot Allocation: Uses Graph Coloring Algorithm to assign time slots.
Database Integration: Timetable stored in MySQL/PostgreSQL for easy retrieval.
User-Friendly Interface: (Optional) A web-based or CLI-based interface to visualize schedules.
💻 Tech Stack
Python/Java – For implementing scheduling logic
MySQL/PostgreSQL – To store and manage timetable data
📌 How It Works
1️⃣ Graph Representation: Exams are represented as nodes, and conflicts (same student in two exams) form edges.
2️⃣ Graph Coloring Algorithm: Assigns the minimum number of time slots while ensuring no conflicts.
3️⃣ Backtracking Optimization: Ensures valid and efficient timetable generation.
4️⃣ Database Storage: Saves and retrieves schedules dynamically.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add a Web Dashboard for viewing schedules.
🔹 Implement Faculty Constraints (e.g., teacher availability).
🔹 Optimize for larger universities with multiple constraints.
